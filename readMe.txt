Welcome to jNotes! This program was developed by Axel R.

You can contact me @ axelriggsgamer@gmail.com

This software is open-source, and you can make it better if you want.

The .class file is the actual program, the .java file is the source code, the

.command file is the open shortcut for MacOS, and the .lnk file is the open

shortcut for Windows. Open the open shortcut for your OS to launch jNotes.

*WARNING: You DO need to install the newest JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

and/or the newest JDK (Java Development Kit) to run jNotes because the

program is written in Java, because:

A. Java is fast.

B. I only know Java so far.

jNotes was developed on March 25, 2021.

Just in case, I'll provide the JDK installers for both systems with the files.

NOTE: JDK only comes with the .zip release if you're on GitHub.
